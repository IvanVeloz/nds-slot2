# NDS Slot 2 reverse engineering documentation

## Motivation
This is intended to be an extension of [jojolebarjos/gba-cartridge](https://github.com/jojolebarjos/gba-cartridge) to the NDS slot 2. It has diferent registers and timings from the
GBA.

Additionally, nobody has done proper timing diagrams for the GBA slot. This is important for designing your own GBA/NDS peripherals. I used [WaveDrom](https://wavedrom.com) for this.
